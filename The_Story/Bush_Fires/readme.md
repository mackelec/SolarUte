# 2019 Australian Black Summer - our months of Fires


2019 was a very dry year, half our annual average rainfall, previous year was also dry.  Australians were warned this was going to be a bad bushfire season, and it was.

This is our preferred entry to the property, a raised track through an area usually under 12" of water.

### Our Bush Block

Going to be my retirement sanctuary, 330 acres of thick forest in Northern NSW, 250km from my city home in Brisbane.  The nearest house is probably 4km away by line of sight.  Normally a beautifull, quiet, with just the sounds of native fauna for company.  

We had built,with our own hands, a cabin and utility building out of the wood we milled from the local trees.  We added 10 kWatts of solar panels, satelite internet, and were happy as pig in mud.  Now where we built the cabin got wet and boggy so we decided that the tractor sheds would go at the top of the property where it is more open and dry.
