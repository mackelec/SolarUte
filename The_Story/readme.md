# SolarUte

###  Introduction

We bought this Ute, 2000 4WD Ford Couier Diesel Ute - which is the same as the Mazda B2500 Ute, to replace our even older 1994 Petrol B2600 4WD Ute.  It was a problem storing petrol on our property so we were converting to Diesel :-).

No sooner than this we endured the [months of Bushfires](https://github.com/mackelec/SolarUte/blob/master/The_Story/Bush_Fires/readme.md), and then the Pandemic!!!  So we were talking about doing an electric car conversion and thought screw it, let's convert 2000 Courier Ute.

This has many advantages on the property since we will have many kiloWatts of solar power - Don't need fuel at all (except the tractors).

###  The Project

#### Motor

After devouring Damien Macguire's video on youtube, We decided to use the Nissan Leaf motor and inverter. The Leaf motor has similar (better) max torque and kWatts as the original diesel engine except the torque of the Leaf is available from quite low RPM.  So we see this as being a very good match.  (Actually, the Leaf motor should feel markedly more torquie and powerful)

#### Geartrain

Most electric conversions don't worry about the clutch.  It is much simpler to fabricate a motor to gearbox coupler this way.  

So naturally we wanted to do this the hard ward and keep the clutch :grinning:
It was decided to keep the clutch because we often have to climb over fallen wattle or branches or may drop a wheel into a divit / hole and may just need the extra torque to climb out, somehow I don't think this will be the case.
